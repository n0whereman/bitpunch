Crystography provides a secure way of communication in today's world. Current cryptography is mainly based on problems, which could be solved by Shor's algorithm by using a quantum computer. Therefore, the existence of Quantum Computers in the range of 1000 bits would be a real world threat. This thesis is dedicated to improvement of cryptographic library, that should be resistant against such threats. 
The thesis contains an overview of McElice cryptosystem and it's security against CCA attacks. The first section discuss necessary preliminaries. In the further section, current state of the library is analysed. The section also contains an analysis of missing features like secure CCA2 conversion, KEM. The other sections of the thesis are dedicated to our contribution and implementation with corresponding tests. In the end of the thesis, accomplished results are discussed.
